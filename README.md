# OCS Recruitment Task

## Overview  
This project is a full-stack web application built using **React (Frontend)** and **Node.js (Backend)**. Due to time constraints, I couldn't host it successfully, but the setup instructions below will help you run it locally.  

In just **9 days**, I learned **React for the frontend** and **Node.js for the backend**, and I also attempted to host the project by following various tutorials. However, I couldn't get it hosted properly within the given time.  

## Prerequisites  
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:  
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)** (Download and install from the official website)  

## Installation & Setup  

### 1. Clone or Extract the Project  
- Download and extract the provided project files into a new folder named **"OCS"**.  

### 2. Running the Backend  
1. Open **Command Prompt** (**Win + R → Type `cmd` → Press Enter**).  
2. Navigate to the **backend** folder:  
Start the backend server by typing this command: " node server.js "
Keep this terminal open, as it runs the backend.

3. Running the Frontend
Open a new Command Prompt window.
Navigate to the frontend folder:
Start the frontend server by typing this command : " npm start"
A new tab should open in your default browser with the application running.

5. Logging In
Use the user_id and password from the provided database to log in.

Hosting Attempt
I attempted to host the project on Vercel, but due to time constraints, I couldn't complete it successfully. Hosting a full-stack application requires proper configuration, which I couldn't accomplish within the given time.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js
Package Manager: npm

Future Improvements
Successfully deploy the project on Vercel or another hosting platform.
Optimize the frontend and backend for better performance.
Improve the database handling for scalability.
